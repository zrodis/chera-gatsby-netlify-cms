# Your Donation Has a Lasting Impact

According to a recent study reported in the Stanford Social Innovation Review, adults who had received charitable sponsorship as children are more likely to finish school, seek higher education, and seek a professional job.

When you support the CHERA Education Program, you enable a child to stay safe, healthy, and in school. Supportors of the CHERA Education Program have the knowledge that they have helped create a new future for a student with the potential to lead and contribute in the Kasese, Uganda community.

### CHERA's Continuing Support of Education

More than 170 children are now enrolled in CHERAâ€™s Education Program, 54% are girls, 46% boys. Since inception, more than 220 students have graduated in different disciplines from universities in Uganda.
