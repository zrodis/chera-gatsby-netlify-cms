# We Can All Make a Difference in Kasese, Uganda

The Rwenzori region of Uganda is known for its natural beauty, wildlife, and one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world. Making motherhood safer region by region is the most effective step we can take to eradicate extreme poverty. It is within our reach and each of us can do our part.

CHERA sponsors the and partners with **The KCHEF Medical Center**, which cares for over 25,000 women and their families each year. The midwives and physicians of the clinic—all drawn from the local community—provide prenatal care, skilled assistance during childbirth, emergency surgical deliveries, infant vaccinations, and prevention of mother-to child transmission of HIV. Keeping the doors of our clinic open to every mother seeking health care for herself and her children depends on the donations of our global family of supporters.

The goal of the **CHERA Education Program** is simple and bold: to give children at very high risk a path toward a future where they can support themselves and their families, and make a positive contribution to their community. CHERA pools donor contributions and partners with local educators and health care leader to deliver the education program and services that are unique to each child’s circumstances, and to ensure more children benefit.
