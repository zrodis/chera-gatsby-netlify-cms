With local leaders and highly trained staff drawn from the community, the [CHERA Health Program](/health) supports a local medical clinic which focuses on obstetric and pediatric medical care, and provides urgent care for all. The [CHERA Education Program](/education) provides funds to at-risk children and orphans so that the regionâ€™s most vulnerable children may complete their education and lead their community into the future. With these pillars of stability in place, hope and progress are real and growing in the Rwenzori region of western Uganda.
