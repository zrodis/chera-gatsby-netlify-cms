# aCHERA PARTNERS WITH KCHEF

July 17, 2016
Melbourne, FL, July 4, 2016, by Robert C. Baldwin — CHERA (Community Health and Education for Rural Africa, Inc.) partners with KCHEF (Kasese Community Health and Education Foundation) to combat the ravages of HIV/AIDS in the Rwenzori region of Southwest Uganda.

Founded in 2002 and supported by Dioceses, Parishes and Individuals throughout the Episcopal Church, CHERA (formerly the Bishop Masereka Christian Foundation – US) has developed into a pre-eminent health and education organization in Kasese, Uganda in partnership with the KCHEF Medical Center and KCHEF Education Program.

In 2015, the KCHEF Medical Center has accomplished the following:

Served over 25,000 patients
Delivered 345 babies
Immunized more than 4,900 patients
Provided HIV counseling and testing to over 2,100 patients
Supported the education of approximately 500 students
While all of the early costs of developing the Medical Clinic were funded by donations, today the clinic is close to being self sufficient through support from local companies, some private pay and assistance from the Ugandan Government.

Almost a generation since its founding and with the commitment of many donor organizations, CHERA and KCHEF see the difference they have made every day in the health of mothers and infants and in the number of graduates that return to Kasese to work and support the CHERA and KCHEF efforts.
