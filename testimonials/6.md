GODFREY BWAMBALE SUCCESS STORY
 December 6, 2016
My name is Godfrey Bwambale. I graduated with a diploma in clinical medicine and community health in 2015 from Fort Portal School of Clinical Officers. I am currently working as a clinical officer with the KCHEF Medical Center since September 2016.

I owe my success to the generosity of well wishers that donated towards the support of the Orphans and Vulnerable Children of KCHEF and CHERA. The year 2006 immersed me in a state of hopelessness when I lost my dad (Protazio Mbwiirahe), who was the sole bread winner for our family of five. My mother, a housewife, could not sustain us in school. Life became increasingly tough for my family by the day and what the future had at stake for me was disheartening.

I was at the verge of dropping out of school in 2007 when I learned about the KCHEF Education Program. I was enrolled as a beneficiary in 2007 while I was in secondary school. The financial and psychosocial support I received enabled me to pull through school to completion and achieve my dream of becoming a professional adult. Now I can commit to benefitting my community as a professional health care worker and will also be part of the efforts to ensure continuity of support to the vulnerable children in my community through my subscription to the KCHEF Education Program Alumni Association. I will forever be grateful to CHERA and the KCHEF Education Program for salvaging me from vulnerability and its distress.
